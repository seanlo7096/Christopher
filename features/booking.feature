Feature: RAW Booking
  In order to get seats at RAW
  As a software engineer 
  I want to build an automatic booking software!

  # Scenario: Browse the website
  #   Given I am on "home" page
  #   Then I should see "superContainer" div

  Scenario: Book a seat
    Given I am on "booking" page
    And I can see "Panel_Booking" div
    When I cannot see loading div
    And I wait for "1" seconds
    And I choose option "2" from "DropDownList_People" dropdown (name)
    And I cannot see loading div
    And I wait until "12" hour "00" min "00" sec
    And I write "07-10" in "TextBox_Date"
    And I click "Label_RTitle"
    And I cannot see loading div
    And I write "Sean Lo" in "TextBox_FName"
    And I write "tzuhsiang.lo@gmail.com" in "TextBox_Email"
    And I write "0237252924" in "TextBox_PNumber"
    And I turn into manual
    And I wait for "2" seconds
    And I write "Sean Lo" in "TextBox_PName"
    And I write "0237252924" in "TextBox_PTel"
    And I write "tzuhsiang.lo@gmail.com" in "TextBox_PEMail"
    And I choose option "Card" from "DropDownList_Payment" dropdown (name)
    And I click "1" for "RadioButtonList_InvoiceType" radio
    And I click "LinkButton_Send"
